Take the last image daughter of a post. To use this plugin you just need to insert one of
the following commands in your template:

- `gi_fullsize ();`
- `gi_medium ();`
- `gi_thumbnail ();`

Adding a parameter, it becames in the tag img generated. By default, the plugin will return
a string containing the tag of the image, but you can pass the second parameter to true to
make the impression of this string.

= Updated in version 0.5 =

Now you have a `gi_library ()` function. It returns all images from yout post - not only the
last daughter, where you can pass some parameters like size and type of return you wants.

The sizes of `gi_library ()` are: 'all', 'fullsize', 'medium', 'thumbnail'

= Upgraded in version 0.8 =

# Added shortcuts for `gi_thumb ()` and `gi_full()`.
# Upgraded for wordpress 2.6
# Added width and height in `gi_library`.
# Using the native `wp_get_attachment_image ()` function.

= Upgraded in version 0.9 =

Now, `gi_fullsize()`, `gi_full()`, `gi_medium()`, `gi_thumbnail()` and `gi_thumb()` recives two parameters.

The first is $print, this param prints the return, use it to shorcur yours call. So, if you wants
to print do not use:

`<?php echo gi_full(); ?>`

But use:

`<?php gi_full(1); ?>`

The second param says the number of image you want to use. This number is the number of image in
galery order. The next code prints the third image in galery on format thumbnail.

`<?php gi_thumb(true, 3); ?>`
